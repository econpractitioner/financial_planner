st.markdown("""
This app compares two retirement options:
- **Option 1:** A pension that pays a fixed amount (600,000 during the joint period and 300,000 thereafter). 
  Any surplus (pension minus expenses) is reinvested at the discount rate.
- **Option 2:** An investment of a fixed principal (6,000,000) from which you withdraw an expense (growing with inflation) every year.
  In this simulation, withdrawals are taken in fullâ€”even if that leads to a negative balance.
  
The starting annual expense is common for both options. Adjust the parameters below to see how your retirement options compare.
